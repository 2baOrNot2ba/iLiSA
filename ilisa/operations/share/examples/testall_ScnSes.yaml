# Example session schedule for testing most recording modes in iLiSA.
#
# Run this example from a shell like this:
# bash$ ilisa_obs testall_ScnSes.yaml
# To check integrity of _ScnSes.yaml file, add '-c' flag:
# bash$ ilisa_obs -c testall_ScnSes.yaml

note: Testing several different scan types
scans:
  # Record ACC and SST using LBA
  - beam:
      freqspec: '10_90'
      pointing: Z
    rec: [acc,sst]
    file_dur: 512
    duration: 519
    id: 1_ACC_SST  # This is the ID and name of folder (prefixed with string 'scan_') containing scan data in session
  # Then 11 mins after start of previous scan, record BFS for 12 s:
  - after: 11m
    beam:
      freqspec: '10_90'
      pointing: Z
    rec: [bfs]
    duration: 12
    id: 2_BFS
  # Record BST in half of band (to get 16bits) for 60s
  # and chunk datafiles into 10s chunks (that are delivered on DRU
  # as soon as the are finished)
  - beam:
      freqspec: '10.1e6:55e6'
      pointing: '3.1415,1.57,AZELGEO'  # Just a bit south of Zenith
    rec: [bst]
    integration: 1
    file_dur: 10  # Size of file recorded in seconds
    duration: 60
    id: 3_BST_nrm_chunked
  # Record freq range (20-235 MHz) spanning all lofar bands (so-called 357 mode)
  # skipping some subbands (subband step 1 MHz):
  - beam:
      freqspec: '20e6:1e6:235e6'
      pointing: Cas-A
    rec: [bst]
    integration:  1
    duration: 10
    id: 4_BST_357
  # Record SST data in HBA
  - beam:
      freqspec: '110_190'
      pointing: S
    rec: [sst]
    integration:  1
    duration: 10
    id: 5_SST
  # Record a XST at 55 MHz for 4*2 seconds integrating over 2 s:
  - beam:
      freqspec: '55e6'
      pointing: '6.123487,1.026515,J2000'  # Cas-A in radian J2000
    rec: [xst]
    integration: 2
    duration: 4*2
    id: 6_XST_nrm
  # Make XSTs over 30-60 MHz in steps of 5 MHz pointing at Sun
  - beam:
      freqspec: '30e6:5e6:60e6'
      pointing: Sun
    rec: [xst]
    integration:  1
    duration: 16  # Eight 1 sec. steps with 1 s switch time.
    id: 7_XST_frq_swp
  # Record allsky visibility XST in HBA. This exploits the tiling OFF (tof) mode
  - beam:
      freqspec: '118e6'
    rec: [xst]
    integration: 4
    duration: 8
    id: 8_HBA_allsky

# This scan-session takes about 15 min.
