Welcome to iLiSA's documentation!
=================================
``iLiSA`` is a software package that allows high-level operation of a LOFAR
station locally also called StandAlone mode.
LOFAR is a low frequency radio telescope consisting of stations located around
Europe, that can be run centrally or locally. In this latter stand-alone mode,
you are pretty much left alone with a fairly low-level interface to basic
telescope operations. This is where ``iLiSA`` comes in. It was developed
by international station owners to allow generic yet fully exploit a LOFAR
station.
